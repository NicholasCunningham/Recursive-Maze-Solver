# Recursive-Maze-Solver
Utilizes recursion to perform a depth-first search of a maze, returning the solution path

This program was created as a major homework assignment near the end of CS 163 - Java: No Prior Programming in the summer of 2018. The program uses a given .txt file with various symbols describing the outline of a maze. Different mazes can be used, given they have the proper formatting. The program calculates the size of the maze, loads it into an array, finds the given starting point, then recursively searches from that point for the solution. It also returns a string representation of the solution path.
